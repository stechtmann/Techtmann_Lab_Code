If you're new to R and/or Python and want a structured tutorial, Data Carpentries are a good place to start:
* [R for ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
* [Python for ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/)  
These start all the way at installation and work their way up to basic graphing; serving as a great primer to how the code here works!
